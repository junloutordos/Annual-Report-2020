                <i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-left quote-icon-left"></i>The School Year 2020-2021 is undeniably like never before. The
                    Curriculum and Instruction Division (CID) had been matched with many
                    challenges as teachers and scholars hurdled the paradigm shifts
                    demanded by remote and blended learning.
                    During the pandemic, our dedication, adaptability, and patience were tested
                    in ways we could never imagine but teachers faced all these head-on,
                    embraced new learning management systems, and devised innovative means
                    in implementing the curriculum from a distance. The CID not only endured and
                    survived the pandemic, but also turned difficulties into opportunities to uphold
                    excellent service by developing innovations such as the CID Online which
                    created a smarter, better coordinated, and more equitable monitoring system
                    that is efficient and consequential for the scholars, teachers, and parents from
                    then onward.<br><br>
                    In this new normal, I am truly grateful to the parents of our scholars for
working hand-in-hand with us in executing classhomesâ€”classrooms at home
and ensuring that learning still continues among our scholars. I am proud of
the academic affairs office for conducting a series of capacity-building activities
for teachers to be equipped in managing their classes remotely. Even with the
abrupt shift, the implementation of the curriculum advanced with minimal
interruptions. The student affairs office leveled off through the utilization of
technology tools and communication channels to ensure that scholars were kept
informed of the opportunities to participate in international, national, and local
competitions where scholars were provided with adequate support through their
coaches. <br><br>
This annual report does not only reflect our continuing service excellence amidst
the pandemic but also highlights the accomplishments of our scholars in winning
various competitions that brought pride to Pisay Caraga. Despite all the
setbacks, 2020 was a successful year and we look forward to a more settled
2021!<i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-right quote-icon-right"></i>
