                The year 2020 is perhaps known for the most abrupt global changes in our lives brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. Suddenly, almost all our processes were adjusted in order to address the different challenges, especially those pertaining to learning  and welfare of everyone. There was no other option that our government could choose but to declare a Public Health Emergency which resulted in stay at home orders.
<br><br>
Schools were closed to ensure teachers and learners were safe. Pisay Caraga through its Management Committee decided on the immediate adjustments and resources to be invested in order to continue the classes online and delivery of services amidst the threat of the virus. Our teachers and non-teaching staff immediately underwent online training as part of the rapid internal response. A survey was immediately made to determine the connectivity and other issues. We acknowledge the hard work that the CID, SSD and FAD staff have to endure in those very challenging times. We commend the leadership of their respective Division Chiefs, Ms. Gretchen Mae B. Empuesto, Ms. Jasmine S. Gumapac and Ms. Charity S. Romano. 
<br><br>
The Management Committee thanks all partners for the support and understanding in the changes  necessary to ensure the scholars’ welfare are addressed.  We commend the scholars for their cooperation and the parents with GPTA President Mr. Dexter G. Soberano for their continued support at home when their kids were learning remotely. Despite a different set up, the scholars were still able to participate and even excelled in online competitions, an unexpected silver lining. 
 In line with our commitment to serving the nation,  we’ve supported the government's effort to contain the spread of COVID-19 virus, keep our communities safe and help the vulnerable. The energy of our staff, scholars and parents/guardians, security and janitorial personnel were harnessed to  realize the COVID-19 initiatives by the Campus  in line with the PSHS System response “PisAyuda” and our own “IskoBigayan”. We are very happy to tell everyone how thankful the frontliners in Butuan City and Caraga Region were, and so were the poor families, senior citizens, and PWDs who received our assistance in various forms. We acknowledge the support of the General PTA , the Student Council and a new partner, our new partner, the Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers (PICE) - Agusan del Norte Chapter. Pisay Caraga was one of the most active institutions serving the communities to help mitigate the impact of the pandemic lockdown and support the frontliners. School Year 2019-2020 ended very differently but we’re very thankful to the Lord for the safety of everyone in the Pisay Caraga Community and the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of many. 
 <br><br>
We have prepared a very grand 1st Commencement Exercises for the pioneering graduates, the 72-member PSHS - CRC Bagwislaya Class of 2020. However, due to the pandemic restrictions the 1st Commencement Exercises with  the theme “Pisay Caraga, Game-Changing the Region” was held virtually on August 10, 2020.
  The Philippine Science High School System under the leadership of Executive Director Lilia T. Habacon, and the guidance of our Chairperson, DOST Secretary Fortunato T. de la Peña  and the members of the Board of Trustees, immediately planned how to manage learning without compromising the welfare of its scholars for SY 2020-2021. The PSHS System was mandated to nurture and support all learners.
The Executive Committee and the Office of the Executive Director started to plan for the opening of School Year 2020-2021 by April 2020. Using the ​​Framework for Rapid Response to COVID-19, the Global Education Innovation Initiative at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Directorate of Education and Skills of the OECD, the ExeCom and the OED went through a checklist of 25 items that served as guides for the development of the PSHS System education strategy.
<br><br>
The PSHS System opened SY 2020-2021 with the Curriculum Under Remote and Blended Learning (CRBL), designed to address the new learning situation under the pandemic. The System decided to adopt a Moodle-based Learning Management System (LMS) named as K-Hub. The collective expertise of our teachers in all campuses was tapped for the modules in all courses. The MIS Unit Heads, LMS Coordinators and LMS Champions were appointed in all campuses. Teachers and scholars underwent learning sessions to get acquainted with the use of the K-Hub. We thank our own MIS Team headed by Engr. Lyndon R. Bermoy which oversees the daunting task of setting up the Campus K-Hub and addresses all the needs of teachers, scholars and non-teaching staff. 
<br><br>
The  System ensured learning continued by formulating and revising existing policies to address various inequities which became visible in the new set up. Laptops and various gadgets from the Campus and the donors were distributed to the teachers and scholars needing help. We purchased additional laptops and equipment to address the need, and established a recording studio. We are thankful to the generous donors, from a Pisay Caraga family which donated 5 brand new desktop computer sets for remote learning, to laptop and gadget donors under the initiative of the Office of the  Executive Director: 1) PSHS Foundation, Inc., 2) PSHS National Alumni Association, 3) Jaime Ongpin Foundation. The laptops and gadgets lending made a big difference in our scholars’ learning and their families which also have other students at home.
<br><br>
Everyone played an important role in the success of the School in the year 2020.  My profound gratitude to all the members of the Pisay Caraga Community, PSHS System ED Lilia T. Habacon and partners for their support.  We continue to pray for God’s protection as we continue to navigate in this very difficult time. Let us support the government in any way we can. As frontliners in the promotion of science and technology, let us advocate for greater compliance to the minimum public health standards, help promote vaccination and other scientific and technological advances that can contribute to the immediate recovery of our country from the devastating effects of this pandemic. Stay safe! Remember, #IAMPISAYCaraga.
