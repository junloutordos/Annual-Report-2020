                Philippine Science High School – Caraga Region Campus continues to thrive in one of the
most challenging years in the history. As everyone fights the COVID-19 pandemic, Pisay
Caraga also remained resilient to all the changes brought about by the prevalent virus. As
Michael Rutter once said, resilience is the ability to bounce back from life’s challenges and
unforeseen difficulties. <br><br>
The Student Services Division strived to adapt to these changes. Work arrangements were
implemented and followed in accordance with IATF and the City Government of Butuan.
Technology was maximized through having training-workshops to capacitate the staff on
adapting and embracing digital transformation in order to continually provide support in this
time of adversity. The staff also contributed during the call for donations and services of Pisay
Caraga to the vulnerable sectors and the frontliners during the COVID-19 pandemic through
the Pisayuda initiatives.

              In order to accommodate the different needs and situations of the scholars, some processes
              were modified such as the enrollment for SY 2020-2021 and clearance for SY 2019-2020.
              The conduct of promotional activities was also a challenge since NCE caravan was
              discouraged in order to lessen the possibility of COVID-19 infection among the personnel
              assigned to conduct the events. Some cities and municipalities in the region were also strict
              in the requirements for entering their borders. Virtual scholarship forums using the Zoom
              platform were hosted instead. All the Department of Education divisions and private schools
              in the region were invited to apply for the Requirements for Admission, Criteria and Evaluation
              (RACE). Posters, application forms and application guidelines were also distributed in the
              nearby municipalities and through the different DepEd Superintendents.<br><br>
              In addition to that, one of the challenges experienced by our scholars is the adjustment to the
              remote and blended learning scheme of the system. The Guidance Center offered tele
              counselling and online conference among the vulnerable scholars and those having difficulty
              with their academics in collaboration with the concerned school personnel, parents and
              guardians. These virtual consultations were also offered to the personnel. Activities that
              promote mental health were also spearheaded by the division including stress management
              
              talk for personnel, parents, and scholars; webinar on social media etiquette and anti-
              cyberbullying; and yoga sessions.
              <br><br>
              On the other hand, the Health Services Unit was successful in keeping the campus COVID-
              19 free through constant monitoring and strict implementation of the minimum health
              
              standards. Orientations on the policies and guidelines on workplace prevention and control of
              COVID-19 were given among the employees. Series of campaign on basic health and safety
              against COVID-19 were also conducted. Community health outreach programs were
              conducted in the Municipality of Buenavista and the City Government of Butuan.
              Teleconsultation was also offered to students and personnel.
              Online services were given by the Library Unit to assist the scholars and teachers in their
              needs for learning resources. These services were explained during the virtual library
              orientation. Due to travel restrictions, the dormitory was only opened to accommodate the
              personnel especially those living outside Butuan.
              <br><br>
              The Student Services Division personnel’s efforts were also transparent during the conduct
              the ISO 9001:2015 2nd Surveillance Audit in the campus contributing to its success. Each unit
              worked hard in maintaining the standards among various processes under the student
              services.
              <br><br>
              The pandemic is far from over. The division will continue to work to make a smoother transition
              to the new normal upholding the core values of truth, excellence and service to our nation and
              all stakeholders.
