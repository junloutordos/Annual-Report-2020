                <br><br>"As the Finance and Administration Head of Philippine Science High School-Caraga Region Campus, I am pleased to present to you our annual report for the school year 2020. This year has been like no other, as the world faced the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these challenges, I am proud to say that our school has continued to provide service excellence to our students and their families.<br><br>
                One of the most significant ways in which we have continued to provide service excellence is through our commitment to providing a safe and healthy environment for our students and staff. We have implemented strict health and safety protocols, such as temperature checks and regular sanitization of our facilities, to help prevent the spread of the virus. Additionally, we have been able to continue providing high-quality education to our students through our transition to remote learning.<br><br>
                


             </p>
            </div>

          </div>

        </div>
        <div class="row gy-4">
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p align = "justify"> 
              Another way in which we have continued to provide service excellence is through our focus on financial stability and transparency. Despite the economic impact of the pandemic, we have been able to maintain our strong financial position by closely managing our expenses and making difficult but necessary decisions. We have also continued to be transparent with our financial information, so the school community can understand our financial situation."
              We also maintained our focus on providing support to our students and staff. We provided extra support and resources to help students who are struggling with remote learning, and made sure that staffs well-being were supported.<br><br>
In addition, the school's community engagement activities were not affected by the pandemic, the school continues to reach out to the community by providing them with educational resources, free-of-charge, and providing them with a safe place to learn.<br><br>
In conclusion, the school year 2020 has been a challenging one, but I am proud of the way in which our school has risen to meet these challenges. We have continued to provide service excellence to our students and their families, and we will continue to do so in the years to come. Thank you for your continued support of Philippine Science High School-Caraga Region Campus."
